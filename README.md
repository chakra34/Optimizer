# Optimizer
Contains an optimization module as well as codes for fitness functions for single crystal nanoindentation simulations using MSC-Marc and DAMASK.

Also added with this are objective function codes to get fitness for spectral solver in DAMASK and DAMASK-Mentat simulation

Author's note
The code is open to use for anyone interested in applying this to identify plasticity parameters.
